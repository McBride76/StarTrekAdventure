# StarTrekAdventure
A browser StarTrek RPG

# SETUP
You will need a local server like XAMPP for a lot of the functionality.

If you download the project, make sure to change the main folder name to just 'StarTrekAdventure', instead of 'StarTrekAdventure-main',
as some of the required links are absolute paths.

http://localhost/StarTrekAdventure/Landing/landing.php is where you are going to want to start but most pages should redirect you anyways.
